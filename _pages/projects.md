### 1. SATORI
I am a team member of the SATORI (SmArt neTwOrking in the eRa) project. For more details, visit: <http://satori-project.net/>.

### 2. FS-MAC+

FS-MAC+ is an intelligent Medium Acess Control sublayer for wireless networks. It automatically selects the best MAC protocol based on network metrics using Machine Learning techniques. FS-MAC+ is implemented using GNU-Radio and have been tested on Software Defined Radios of the family Ettus USRP B200.

### 3. MAC protocols for SDR

This is part of a short project I had started during the course "Intelligent Networks" at the Federal University of Minas Gerais in 2017/2. This project consists of MAC protocols for use in SDR. I have used the PHY layer from the _gr-ieee802-11_ project. By now, there 2 MAC protocols fully implemented, CSMA/CA and TDMA. .

### 4. Alternative algorithm for ANR in LTE networks

This project was developed during my bachelor's degree thesis. It proposes an algorithm that efficiently and automatically fulfills ANR (Automatic Neighbour Relation) tables in LTE networks.
