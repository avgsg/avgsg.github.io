I am a Telecommunications/Computer Engineer (BS/MS/PhD-in progress) with professional experience in Technical Support Engineering (tiers 1-3) and Computer Networks Management. Over the years, I have developed strong proficiency in Python, Linux (mostly Debian/Ubuntu), Bash Scripting, Computer/Wireless Networks, and lately endeavoured in Machine Learning and Data Science. Among some relevant soft-skills, I list fast learner, team worker, and a good communicator.

My complete CV is available [here](./files/cv-complete.pdf).
