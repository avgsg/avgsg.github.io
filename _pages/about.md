I'm a Telecommunications Engineer with professional experience in Technical Support Engineering and research experience in Wireless Networks. I hold an engineering bachelor's degree from the Federal University of São João del-Rei (Brazil), which was partly taken as a foreign student at the University of Adelaide (Australia), and a master's degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (Brazil). Currently, I'm a PhD student in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at the Trinity College Dublin (Ireland) under the supervision of Prof. Luiz Da Silva. My research interests are mostly related to Machine Learning applications, Cognitive and Self-Organizing Networks.

Some of my most recently used technical skills are displayed below. The percentage is an estimate of how frequently I have been using them by comparison with each other.
